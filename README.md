Simply, I wanted to create a machine learning program that can classify images of the original 151 pokemon.  For some reason the images set that I found only has 
149 pokemon, no idea why :/

Link to the images that are currently being used can be found here:  https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one

Currently the next iteration of this project is to expand the classification to all the pokemon through all 8 generation....and however many pokemon there are at this point
